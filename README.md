# PIE-Mini-Project-1
The following report aims at introducing the principles of circuits and embedded software in a project where students are able to build a bike light with a push-down button, LED's, and a potentiometer. The bike light must be able to change different modes with a press of the push-down button, as well as vary brightness using the potentiometer. 

### Abstract:
In this mini-project, we were tasked to create a bike light that was capable of switching between several modes of flashing, as well as incorporating a potentiometer to modify the brightness of the LED's in real time.
